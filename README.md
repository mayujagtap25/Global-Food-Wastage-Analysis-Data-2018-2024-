Key Sections: 
1. Top Metrics: 
• Avg of Avg Waste Per Capita: 109.46 (average food waste per person). 
• Economic Loss: 125.20M (total financial loss due to food waste). 
• Population: 3.53M (considered population size). 
• Total Waste (Tons): 125.31M (total quantity of food waste globally). 
2. Food Waste Breakdown by Category: 
• A donut chart shows the distribution of total food waste (in tons) by different 
food categories such as: 
• Prepared Food (14.31%) 
• Beverages (13.05%) 
• Bakery Items (12.01%) 
• Frozen Food (12.27%) 
• Fruits & Vegetables (12.44%) 
• Meat & Seafood 
• Dairy Products 
3. Geographical Impact (Map Visualization): 
• Displays the sum of economic loss and total waste (tons) by country. 
• Darker shades indicate higher economic losses due to food wastage. 
4. Population vs. Household Waste by Food Category: 
• A bar chart compares the population (million) and household waste (%) per 
food category. 
• Example: Prepared food waste is the highest, while grains & cereals have 
relatively lower waste. 
5. Economic Loss vs. Total Waste Correlation (Scatter Plot): 
• A trendline indicates a positive correlation between food waste (tons) and 
economic loss (million dollars). 
• The more food wasted, the higher the financial loss. 
Filters: 
• Food Category: Allows selection of specific food types (Bakery, Beverages, Frozen 
Food, etc.). 
• Country: Filters data by specific regions. 
• Year: Allows comparison between different years (2018 & 2024). 
Conclusion: 
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into food waste trends, economic impact, 
and regional disparities. It helps in identifying key focus areas for reducing food waste and 
economic losses globally.
